Introduced the key functionalities of our Forum dApp smart contract. These are:

- Creation of Posts - Users can create posts to initiate discussions
- Creation of Poll - Users can create polls to gather opinions
- Creation of Comments - Users can comment on posts to engage in conversations
- User Engagement through Upvotes - Users can upvote or like posts and comments
Now, it's time to bring these functionalities to life through the frontend!

Our goal is to build a user-friendly interface that will allow seamless interaction with the Forum smart contract.

If you are in the site, you can sign In with your wallet and select Arbitrum Sepolia, since the Forum smart contract for the site was deployed there.

Feel free to post, comment or start a poll to experience the Forum platform! Once you're done exploring, we'll move on to the next step!
